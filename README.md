# IoT-based Campus Water Level Monitoring & Management System

## Overview

This project is an IoT-based water level monitoring and management system designed to efficiently monitor water tank levels across a campus. The system uses IoT devices to sense water levels, track truck locations via GPS, and transmit this data to the cloud for further processing and monitoring. It provides real-time updates and alerts to users, making it an effective solution for campus water management.

## Project Features

- **Real-Time Water Level Monitoring**: Continuously tracks water tank levels using ultrasonic water level sensors (HC-SR04).
- **GPS Tracking**: Uses GPS modules (NEO-6M) to monitor truck locations for efficient water distribution.
- **Cloud Integration**: Data is transmitted to the cloud via 4G, where it is stored and analyzed.
- **Mobile App Interface**: Real-time data and alerts are available through a mobile app for easy monitoring.
- **Solar-Powered**: The system is powered by solar panels, making it energy-efficient and sustainable.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for low water levels or abnormal conditions to alert users.

   - Upload the code to the ESP32 to read sensor data and send it to the cloud.
   - Configure Firebase or AWS DynamoDB to store sensor data.

3. **Mobile App Setup**:
   - Install the mobile app on your device.
   - The app will display real-time water level data, truck location, and send alerts if water levels are low.

4. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Set up cloud-based alerts and notifications using services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Twilio.
